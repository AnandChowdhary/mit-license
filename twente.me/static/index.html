                <p>Twente License is a fork of the MIT license. It aims to combine openly sharing knowledge (i.e., a permissive, open license) with added values like respectivng individual privacy by committing to transparency.</p>
                <h2>Rationale</h2>
                <p>The MIT license is the most popular open-source license out there. It's used by millions of projects and helps the community by providing open access to code, so that developers can build on top of the hard work done by others.</p>
                <p>However, in light of recent events where companies are financially motivated to disregard individual privacy, developers should choose wisely who can use their intellectual property or codebases.</p>
                <p>Twente License is free and permissive—just like the MIT license—but it adds a clause where the end product in which Twente licensed code can be used has to be compliant with certain guidelines, primarily respecting individual privacy by telling users how their information is shared.</p>
