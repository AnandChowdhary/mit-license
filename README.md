# Twente License [![Twente License](https://twente.me/shield.svg)](https://twente.me) ![Work in progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/work%20in-progress-green.svg)

Twente License is a fork of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). It aims to combine openly sharing knowledge (i.e., a permissive, open license) with added European values like respective individual privacy.

## 💡 Rationale

The MIT license is the [most popular](https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/) open-source license out there. It's used by millions of projects and helps the community by providing open access to code, so that developers can build on top of the hard work done by others.

However, in light of recent events where companies are financially motivated to disregard individual privacy, developers should choose wisely who can use their intellectual property or codebases.

Twente License is free and permissive—just like the MIT license—but it adds a clause where the end product in which Twente licensed code can be used has to be compliant with certain guidelines, primarily respecting individual privacy.

## 🐎 Why Twente?

The European Union (EU) has been in the center of enforcing privacy on the web with regulations such as the GDPR. While the United States Senate was busy asking [how Facebook is free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2H8wx1aBiQ), the EU has imposed millions of euros worth of fines on companies for lack of transparency and disregarding privacy.

Twente License is named after [University of Twente](https://utwente.nl/en/?utm_source=twente-license&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=README&utm_term=anand-chowdhary), where it originated, and the high-tech entrepreneurial region of [Twente](https://www.visittwente.com/?utm_source=twente-license&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=README&utm_term=anand-chowdhary) in the eastern part of the Netherlands.

## 🤔 FAQ

#### Can I use Twente License in a commercial, proprietary project?

Absolutely. The license does not force you to release your code under an open-source license, it only asks you to respect certain values, like individual privacy.

#### Can I just switch from MIT to Twente License without changing my codebase?

My probably, yes. Since open-source packages don't usually collect any personal information, you can just replace the MIT license text with the Twente License text in your `LICENSE.md` file. However, if you are planning on releasing a product (such as an app, a website, etc.) under the Twente License, make sure you comply with the rules before switching.

#### Can I add my own set of values in Twente License?

You're free to fork the license and create your own version (this repository is Twente licensed), and we care currently working on a way to automatically generate custom-value versions of Twente License using twente.me.

#### Do I need to comply with the GDPR to use Twente License?

The GDPR is much broader in requirements and includes hiring a Data Protection Officer, having an option to export and delete data, etc. Twente License only asks you to respect privacy, but complying with the GDPR means you automatically qualify for Twente License too.

#### Do you have a presskit to promote Twente License?

Not yet, but we are working on it.
