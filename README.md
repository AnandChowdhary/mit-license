The Twente License is a fork of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). It aims to combine openly sharing knowledge (i.e., a permissive, open license) with European values like privacy, human rights, and equality.

## 💡 Rationale

The MIT license is the [most popular](https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/) open-source license out there. It's used by millions of projects and helps the community by providing open access to code, so that developers can build on top of the hard work done by others.

However, in light of recent events where companies are financially motivated to disregard individual privacy, developers should choose wisely who can use their intellectual property or codebases.

The Twente License is free and permissive—just like the MIT license—but it adds a clause where the end product in which Twente licensed code can be used has to be compliant with certain guidelines, primarily respecting privacy, human rights, and other European values.

## 🐎 Why Twente?

The European Union (EU) has been in the center of enforcing privacy on the web with regulations such as the GDPR. While the United States Senate was busy asking [how Facebook makes money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2H8wx1aBiQ), the EU has imposed millions of euros worth of fines on companies for lack of transparency and disregarding privacy.

The Twente License is named after [University of Twente](https://www.utwente.nl/en/), where it originated, and the high-tech entrepreneurial region of [Twente](https://www.visittwente.com) in the eastern part of the Netherlands.
