# Twente License [![Twente License](https://twente.me/shield.svg)](https://twente.me) ![Work in progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/work%20in-progress-green.svg)

Twente License is a fork of the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). It aims to combine openly sharing knowledge (i.e., a permissive, open license) with added values like respectivng individual privacy by committing to transparency.

## üí° Rationale

The MIT license is the [most popular](https://github.blog/2015-03-09-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com/) open-source license out there. It's used by millions of projects and helps the community by providing open access to code, so that developers can build on top of the hard work done by others.

However, in light of recent events where companies are financially motivated to disregard individual privacy, developers should choose wisely who can use their intellectual property or codebases.

Twente License is free and permissive‚Äîjust like the MIT license‚Äîbut it adds a clause where the end product in which Twente licensed code can be used has to be compliant with certain guidelines, primarily respecting individual privacy by telling users how their information is shared.

## üêé Why Twente?

The European Union (EU) has been in the center of enforcing privacy on the web with regulations such as the GDPR. While the United States Senate was busy asking [how Facebook is free](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2H8wx1aBiQ), the EU has imposed millions of euros worth of fines on companies for lack of transparency and disregarding privacy.

Twente License is named after [University of Twente](https://utwente.nl/en/?utm_source=twente-license&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=README&utm_term=anand-chowdhary), where it originated, and the high-tech entrepreneurial region of [Twente](https://www.visittwente.com/?utm_source=twente-license&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=README&utm_term=anand-chowdhary) in the eastern part of the Netherlands.

## ü§î FAQ

#### Can I use Twente Licensed code in a commercial, proprietary project?

Absolutely. The license does not force you to release your code under an open-source license, it only asks you to respect certain values, like individual privacy.

#### Can I just switch from MIT to Twente License without changing my codebase?

My probably, yes. Since open-source packages don't usually collect any personal information, you can just replace the MIT license text with the Twente License text in your `LICENSE.md` file. However, if you are planning on releasing a product (such as an app, a website, etc.) with code under the Twente License, make sure you comply with the rules before switching.

#### Do I need to comply with the GDPR to use Twente License?

The GDPR is much broader in requirements and includes hiring a Data Protection Officer, having an option to export and delete data, etc. Twente License only asks you for transparency, but complying with the GDPR means you automatically qualify for Twente License as well.

#### Is Twente License part of the SPDX License List and OSI-approved?

Not yet, but it has been submitted to both SPDX ([#11](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/twente-license/issues/11)) and OSI ([#10](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/twente-license/issues/10)), pending reviews.
